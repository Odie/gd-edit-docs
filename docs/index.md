# gd-edit

Edit your GD character quickly from the commandline!

---

gd-edit is a handy little utility that lets you modify your Grim Dawn
characters however you like! Be warned though that this *is* a commandline
utility. If working with commandline programs seem like a relic of the past for
you, you may also want to consider using [GD
stash](http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=23414).

## Installation
This little program needs Java 8 to run. To get your very own copy, visit
[java.com](https://java.com/download/).

Then, grab a copy of the editor for your platform:

- [Windows version](http://tiny.cc/gdedexe)

- [Linux version](http://tiny.cc/gdednixbin)

Just double click the downloaded exe and you're ready to go!

## Setting up
If you're running the steam version GD, the program should hopefully find your
installation and be ready to go right out of the box.

If you're not running the steam version, or if you have GD installed in some
super secret custom path, then you'll need to help the program find your game
installation and save directory.

In those cases, please run the following commands the first time you fire up
the editor:

```
gamedir "long path to game installation directory here"
savedir "long path to save game directory here"
```

!!! note
    The directory paths should placed inside double quotes. Otherwise, the program
    will stop processing the path when it encounters the first 'space' character in
    the path!
